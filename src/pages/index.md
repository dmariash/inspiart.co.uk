  # Hi, I'm Stella!

  I am a passionate artist and art tutor, offering art classes in my studio in Woking, Guildford, Surrey and the surrounging area. 
  
  I love teaching, being creative and inspiring my students. My friendly approach will help you easily grasp the important rules of drawing and painting, including the use of perspective, sense of space, light and shade, colour and other basics.
  
  Observation is key in study of any subject and I am going to concentrate on this technique and how to apply this knowledge correctly in your artistic works. I endeavour to tailor my approach to unique individual needs of each of my students, carefully judging my pace, using elements of fun, music and a wide range of media throughout the course.
  
  In my lessons I'm incorporating vocabulary and knowledge of specialist terms relevant to the chosen area study.
